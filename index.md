# About:

Hi!
I'm a PhD in computer science.
I wrote my [PhD thesis](https://disser.spbu.ru/files/disser2/disser/5cp32FwxGH.pdf) on traversal-based normalization in March 2018.
I graduated from the St. Petersburg State University, Mathematics and Mechanics Faculty, Department of Computer Science in 2014.
Nowadays, I am a senior researcher at [*Programming Languages and Tools Lab*](https://research.jetbrains.org/groups/plt_lab/), [JetBrains Research](https://research.jetbrains.org/), The Netherlands.
